## 100k-thermist.csv

This is a dataset taken from [this](http://www.robotdigg.com/upload/pdf/100k-thermistor.doc) word document for a 100k thermistors [Part No. HT100K3950-1](http://www.robotdigg.com/product/198/3950+100k+thermistor+with+1m+cables).

I simply just took the data in the .doc and put it into a csv.
